                <h3>Hobbies‚≠ê</h3>
                <b>Volleyball:</b> I've played for close to a decade now and became decent but 
                felt discouraged by height differences all the time :<. 
                Now it's casual from time to time but I still love the sport and am always happy to play.
                <br> <br>
                <b>Games:</b> I've grown up with them and can be pretty good sometimes :>. 
                Recently it's been alot of Marvel Rivals, Valorant and casual games but I find them all fun.
                <br> <br>
                <b>Cats:</b> are cute.
                <br> <br>
                <b>Anime:</b> I've watched alot.

                <h3>Experiences</h3>
                Over the past 3 years, I've been exploring different routes in 
                Computer Science and have grown to love UI/UX design and the idea of front-end development in general.
                <br><br>
                I've been doing alot of self-learning in UI/UX, HTML, CSS, SQL and that itself has been an exciting journey. 
                Other languages include, Python3, Java, JavaScript, C.
                <br><br>
                Thank you for exploring! :>
